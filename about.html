      <h1>About Me</h1>
      Hello! My name is Bill. I am a freshman at MIT majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am interested in the intersection of scientific innovation and the application of that technology into our everyday lives. 
      <br>
      <h1>Computer Science</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Computer science is very versatile! In fact, this website would not have been possible without it.</li>
        <li>I am involved in competitive programming, making it to the Platinum division of the USA Computing Olympiad.</li>
        <li>Through my research, I have extensive experience with various python packages, including pandas, numpy, astropy, and matplotlib.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h1>Math</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Mathematics is at the foundation of every STEM subject. It was my first ever introduction to problem-solving, and I still love it!</li>
        <li>In high school, I was involved in competitive mathematics, qualifying for the USA Mathematics Olympiad my junior and senior year.</li>
        <li>My senior year summer, I was a teacher assistant for <a href = "https://www.awesomemath.org/">Awesome Math Summer Program</a>, where I was a TA for advanced Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Algebra.</li>
        <li>I have taught competitive mathematics extensively, more details in the <a href = "https://wang-bill.github.io/teaching.html">teaching</a> section</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h1>Physics</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>My life is a never-ending conquest to find out how the world works, and there's no better way of doing that than studying physics.</li>
        <li>My favorite subject within physics is oscillations. Oscillations are at the core of many phenomenons in the universe.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h1>Other interests</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>I was on my high school's Cross Country and track team, and in my free time, I love to go on long runs.</li>
        <li>I've played violin since fifth grade, and love to fiddle around with it in my downtime!</li>
