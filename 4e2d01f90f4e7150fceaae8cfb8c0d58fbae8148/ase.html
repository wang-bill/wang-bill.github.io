      <h3>Special Notes</h3>
      Due to complications, for a period of time I will be teaching Novice and Advanced. Below are these special notes.
      <ol>
        <li>09/25/20 Lesson Notes (<a href="Handouts/ASE_2020_21_Special_Notes__09_25_20.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        Today we went over decimals, fractions, and percentages. There are a lot of problems - try as many as you can.
        <li>10/02/20</li>
        Today we went over some questions from Sunday's test, so we don't have any topic based homework. The test questions and review can be found on <b>T1 Novice/Advanced Information</b>, which should be shared to all ASE Math Masters. For homework, please complete: 1) TMSCA NS/General Math and 2) MathLeague NS/Sprint. If you have time, please do a ML Target test or a TMSCA Calculator test. Also note that on today's test review, I have included some extra questions and a quiz at the back. Please complete those.
        <li>10/09/20</li>
        Today we took a Team test and went over some problems on it. For homework, please complete a ML NS/Sprint/Target. If you have time, do more.

Please complete the problems at the end as homework (located in the printable). Let me know if you have any questions! Edit: I have attached the Geometry Formulas section of the UIL Calculator Manual. Some of the formulas are not too useful, but I recommend that you look through it and memorize some of the basic volume formulas, especially for spheres, cones, and cylinder.
        <li>08/02/20 Lesson Notes (<a href="Handouts/ASE_2020_21_Notes__08_02_20.pdf"><div class="twoltip">Handout<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>) (<a href="Handouts/ASE_2020_21_Notes__08_02_20_Printable.pdf"><div class="twoltip">Printable<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>) (<a href="Handouts/uil_calc_app_cont_man-57-58.pdf"><div class="twoltip">More Exponent Explanations<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        Today we went over Squares Ending in 5 in Number Sense, Exponents of Large Numbers in Calculator, and Trigonometry in General Math. We did not finish trigonometry, and will be discussing more of it next week. For fun, I decided to give you all 50 Calculator problems to do (all using Exponents of Large Numbers). You do not need to do them all, but please try as many as possible! I have also attached another explanation from the UIL Calculator Manual. It is not as good as the one inside the handout, but I recommend you read over it to see if that makes more sense to you. Just make sure you understand it!
        <li>08/09/20 Lesson Notes (<a href="Handouts/ASE_2020_21_Notes__08_09_20.pdf"><div class="twoltip">Handout<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>) (<a href="Handouts/ASE_2020_21_Notes__08_09_20_Printable.pdf"><div class="twoltip">Printable<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        Today we went over Squares From 41-51 in Number Sense, More Stated Problems in Calculator, and an actual MathLeague test in General Math. I debated explaining more on trigonometry, but I ultimately decided against teaching it, since it isn't too relevant in elementary school. Instead, I think the students will benefit from actually attempting a MathLeague test!
        <li>08/16/20 Lesson Notes (<a href="Handouts/ASE_2020_21_Notes__08_16_20.pdf"><div class="twoltip">Handout<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>) (<a href="Handouts/ASE_2020_21_Notes__08_16_20_Printable.pdf"><div class="twoltip">Printable<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
