      <h3>Season 3</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Online Classes Season 3 Introduction (<a href="Handouts/Online_Classes_Season_3_Information.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        An introduction to Online Classes Season 3. Please read this if you are interested in joining.
        <li>Math Level 2 Handouts Week 1 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_Handouts_Week_01.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered polynomials. There are a lot of problems at the end to try, and completing them will make the student very proficient in important theorems of polynomials as well as various techniques involved with polynomials.
        <li>Math Level 2 Handouts Week 2 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_Handouts_Week_02.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered sequences and series. The main strategies are identifying the pattern of the sequence and seeing how parts of a series sum together, and we will explore this more in the handout.
        <li>Math Level 2 Handouts Week 3 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_Handouts_Week_03.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered triangles. There are many important properties, so I would recommend trying to understand the theorems then attempting the problems. We did not go over perimeter and medians, so read over those alone.
        <li>Math Level 2 Handouts Week 4 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_Handouts_Week_04.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>

        These are the combined PDFs of the handouts from Week 1 to 4. Week 1 covered Stars and Bars, Week 2 covered Counting Tricks and Probability, Week 3 covered Basic Geometry, and Week 4 covered Basic Trigonometry and Mass Points.
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 5 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts___Week_5.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered overcounting (and also undercounting). By adding cases that weren't counted and subtracting cases that were, we can solve many contest problems!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 6 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Counting_Tricks_and_Geometric_Probability.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered a few counting tricks and geometric probability. 
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 7 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Units_Digit.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered a portion of number theory regarding units digits. While there aren't many formulas needed, make sure to do any problems we do not cover in class because the problems are good exercises.
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 8 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Linear_Congruences.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered a portion of number theory regarding linear congruences. The questions start off simple, but get harder towards the end, so make sure to do any problems we do not cover in class because the problems are good exercises!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 9-11 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Number_Theory_Basics.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we took a step back and covered a few number theory basics. The language I use to code the handouts, TeX, allows me to switch up the style of the handouts, so I decided to make it look a little different to emphasize important points. This week is a little easier than normal, in order to aid those who are inexperienced with number theory. That being said, for those who don't knonw these topics, please do the problems at the end! 
        We used this same handout for Week 10, because we didn't finish all the material in Week 9. Of course, still attempt the problems!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 11 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Stars_and_Bars.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        In addition to finishing up last week's handout, we also went over Stars and Bars. This is a VERY important topic, so make sure to answer the problems at the end!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 12-14 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Review_of_AMC_8_and_Mathcounts.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        In addition to finishing up last week's handout, we also went over part of 2019 AMC 8 and Mathcounts. I have linked the problems in the handout. We also used this for week 13 and 14. Be sure to try as many as possible - this will test how much you learned from this class!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 14 (<a href="Handouts/Mathcounts_Chapter_Sprint_2019.pdf"><div class="twoltip">2019 Sprint<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>) (<a href="Handouts/Mathcounts_Chapter_Target_2019.pdf"><div class="twoltip">2019 Target<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        In addition to finishing up last week's handout, we also went over 2019 Mathcounts Target and part of 2019 Mathcounts State. The questions are attached so you can try them yourself!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 15-16 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Advanced_Sequences_and_Series.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered advanced sequences and series. We also finished up some problems in Week 16. The questions are attached so you can try them yourself!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 16 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Rate_Problems.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
