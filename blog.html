            Stuck in traffic thoughts
        </h2>
        <div id="bp1" class="collapse">
            <p>My friend recently got a job at McDonalds, so naturally I decided to go to <strike>get some free food</strike> say hi, but unfortunately I went right at the middle of rush hour so I was stuck in traffic for a loooong time.</p>

            <p>While stuck in the endless line of cars, to free my mind a bit, I tried to calculate how long I would be stuck behind the light. At first it was just something to occupy my mind, but the problem actually became quite interesting.</p>

            <p>The average human reaction time is about a quarter of a second. The average length of a car is about 4.5 meters -- at the time I did not know this, and tried to mentally measure the length of a car; I arrived at a value of 6 meters, but it’s not so much off since in southern Texas (where I live) there are a lot of pickup trucks and 18-wheelers, which will definitely skew the value, so I’ll use the value of 6 meters for the remaining calculations.</p>

            <p>If we use the brake lights as a measurement of speed, then in the ideal scenario, the turning off of the brake lights would travel at a rate of 6 meters/0.25 seconds = 24 m/s. </p>

            <p>However, there are two main factors we have to consider. The first is that the cars are not stopped right behind each other. On average, I estimated that there’s about three-quarters of a car length between each car, so the value we have to use is (6 meters)(1.75) = 10.5 meters. Second, 0.25 seconds is way underestimating the time from when the first car releases its brakes to when the second car does. It could take an upwards of 5 seconds for the sequence to commence if someone is not paying attention, and usually people wait a few moments after the brake lights of the car in front have gone off to release their own brakes. On average, I estimated about 2 seconds between each car. This gives us a speed of 10.5 meters/2 seconds = 5.25 m/s.</p>

            <p>An interesting parallel that I noticed is the similarity of the traffic problem with waves. In optics, if an object is more densely packed, the index of refraction tends to be higher, which means the speed of the wave would be slower. This is true with traffic -- if the cars are more densely packed, the “brake light speed” would be slower. Furthermore, you can think of the distance from the front of one car to the front of the second car as a “wavelength” and the time it takes for the brake light to travel as the period.</p>

            <p>This is about as far as I got before finally arriving at McDonalds. However, now I have plenty of fruit for thought next time I am stuck in traffic. For example, here I measured speed of propagation using the brake lights, but this is not really a good measurement because in reality, cars would accelerate to a certain speed, not travel at constant velocity. Another thing would be thinking about the optimal time for traffic lights to change. I’m sure these are all challenges traffic engineers have faced and solved before, but it’s still a really interesting problem to think about.</p>

            My take on public bathrooms
        </h2>
        <div id="bp2" class="collapse">
            <p>Imagine the following scenario: You are a high schooler and it is lunch time. As always, your morning classes were boring so you and your friends have to take full advantage of lunchtime to make the day interesting. One of your friends, who likes to see people suffer and knows that you have a low tolerance for spicy food, comes up with a challenge: Eat a whole bag of hot Cheetos without drinking any water or milk. </p>

            <p>Knowing that not accepting the challenge would be social suicide, you grudgingly agree to it and start mentally preparing yourself for the next few minutes of torture. You eventually gather your nerves up and start eating. Immediately, your mouth is filled with a burning sensation that seems to reach every cell of your body. However, not wanting to appear weak, you ignore the pain and somehow finish the whole bag. Immediately after you finish, you grab your milk and start chugging to try to extinguish the burning inferno in your mouth. After chugging the whole carton, your pain becomes manageable, but then you realize there is an odd taste in your mouth. Having a bad feeling, you check the date on the milk carton and it turns out the milk has been expired for three weeks. You shrug it off and eat some delicious public school cafeteria pizza to get rid of the bad taste in your mouth, forgetting about the whole scenario within five minutes.</p>

            <p>However, your stomach has not forgotten about it. As you leave the lunch room, your intestines have already started the digestion process. First it digests the food you ate before the hot Cheetos challenge. Those pass through fine. Then it digests the hot Cheetos. Those also pass through fine. But trouble arises when it starts on the spoiled milk. As your intestines start the digestion process, the milk starts releasing <i>Lactobacilli</i>, a strain of bacteria known to thrive within spoiled milk.</p>

            <p>Your intestines, wanting to get rid of the bacteria, start contracting and expanding. Gradually at first, but more and more so as bacteria production picks up. After a while, you feel the movements and interpret it as the familiar feeling of having to go to the restroom. But you’re in math class and have a test the next day, and you still don’t know why the teacher is writing the word “log” on the board so often -- what does a tree trunk have to do with math? You try to hold it in for as long as you can, but after a while, it becomes obvious that there’s no other option. You ask to use the restroom, and awkwardly sprint to the nearest one. However, you are met with a shocking sight -- the toilet seats are covered in a dark, murky, yellow-ish liquid, and the level of water in the bowl is so high that it is almost up to the toilet seat; furthermore, there are half-dissolved pieces of poop floating in the contaminated water. The putrid smell almost makes you throw up and you quickly try the next stall. The situation is similar, as is the third stall. Thinking quickly, you decide to try another bathroom. But this bathroom has another surprise for you presented in the form of mysterious red substance smeared all over the walls of the stall and green, furry molds of bacteria covering half of the toilet seat. Doing your business here is clearly not a viable option. By this point, you really have to go, so you pray to all the religions you know and run to a third bathroom. The toilet paper holder has a huge dent in it, as if someone had roundhouse kicked it, but by some miracle the toilets look relatively clean, or so you thought. After you finish your business and try to get up you realize that you can’t. You were stuck to the toilet, bound by some sort of adhesive substance on the toilet seat. Suppressing a scream, you push up with all the strength you had and free yourself from the toilet. You quickly grab as much toilet paper as possible and clean yourself the best you could. But it was too late. That night, you discover a rash had formed, resulting in pain and itchiness for the next few weeks.</p>

            <p>Although this scenario is an extreme case of what could happen, it’s not so far off from what I’ve seen in public bathrooms. What makes bathroom vandalism even more worthy of anger is that a lot of the stuff done to the bathrooms seems intentional, as there should be no reason for lab notebooks, dictionaries, or lunch trays to end up in the toilet. When I was younger, I did some janitorial work for a period of time. The work is tougher than any job I’ve had since then, even when the toilets are clean. I have immense respect for janitors, and it absolutely drives me nuts when people intentionally make their lives harder.</p>

            Red or blue pill?
        </h2>
        <div id="bp3" class="collapse">
            <p>For some background (copied from Wikipedia), the terms red pill and blue pill refer to a choice between the willingness to learn a potentially unsettling or life-changing truth, by taking the red pill, or remaining in contented ignorance with the blue pill. The terms refer to a scene in the 1999 film The Matrix.</p>

            <p>What is the purpose of human life? The answer, although it can become complicated philosophically, at the fundamental level is just serotonin. Some actions, although seemingly selfless; for example, a mother sacrificing herself for the life of her child, is masked as just another attempt of feeling that rush of serotonin -- in this case, the feeling of relief that her child survived. What differentiates humans is we have the ability to think long term -- If I complete an assignment now rather than do things I want to do then I’ll be able to do those things later, and also not have to feel the stress of completing something five minutes before it’s due; therefore, I maximize my serotonin output by doing this now. Life is all about maximizing this output of serotonin. However, some people are bad at math and miscalculate -- drinking at a party to feel that instant rush of serotonin, then later getting killed by drunk driving -- is a prime example.</p>
            
            <p>Our consciousness, the world as we know it, is governed by a series of intricate electron movements through our brain cells. Electrons and magnetic fields are not new to human beings. We have been mathematically controlling them ever since the development of Maxwell’s equations. This means that given advanced enough engineering, we could create an entire new world for a person. From the person’s birth as an embryo, we could eject a nonstop rush of every good feeling there is possible into the person. The person will feel a nonstop bliss, and likely live a very fulfilling life before dying of physical deterioration. This is the blue pill at its most extreme.</p>
            
            <p>The red pill gives an alternative scenario, one where constant suffering is felt, with the gift of knowing the “truth.” What exactly is the “truth,” though? For many centuries, physicists thought an atom was the smallest possible object known to mankind, then came the discovery of protons, then came quarks, and now we have string theory. No doubt many more similar discoveries will be made, each one more bizarre than before. I believe the truth to be mathematically describing the world around us with an infinite accuracy and an intuitive understanding. However, this has been proven to not be possible by the Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle. Therefore, the truth that the red pill gives will never be good enough.</p>
            
            <p>The choice is obvious here.</p>
            
            <p>(I should mention that if I were asked to make the choice on the spot, I would definitely miscalculate and choose the red pill. Gaining more insight in the inner workings of the universe has always been a huge goal of mine, and to understand even just a bit more would be a huge accomplishment for me).</p>
